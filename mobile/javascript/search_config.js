He  came  armed  with  a  high-           positive  for  cocaine.  Tortorici  was  arrested  for       powered  rifle  and  a  hunting  knife,            kidnapping,  aggravated  assault,  and  attempted        hidden  under  his  clothes,  and  held  a         murder.

The  situation  turned        terribly  violent  when  a  19-year-old       sophomore,  Jason  McEnaney,  charged        Tortorici  to  take  away  the  rifle.
